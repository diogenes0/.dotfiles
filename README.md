# George's Dotfiles

These are the dotfiles for my Arch Linux setup with i3 and KDE.

Highlights:
  - zsh with [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme
  - Use bat as to view man pages with pretty colors [.zshrc](.zshrc)
  - Keep track of dotfiles in Git using the alias `config` [.zsh_my_aliases](.zsh_my_aliases)
  - List of Arch packages and a script for installing that's only slightly broken! [.dotfiles/setup.sh](.dotfiles/setup.sh)
